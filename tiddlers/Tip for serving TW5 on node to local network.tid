Tip for serving TW5 on node to local network - Google Groups https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/tiddlywiki/Zzs62iEzzCc/zuUwy3Z2nb4J;context-place=forum/tiddlywiki 

This is how I start my TiddlyWikis:

Create a batch file titled like: start_wiki_8083.bat
This is simply a text tile. I title it that way so I remember that this wiki will be started on port 8083

in that file put

```
@echo off
tiddlywiki .\WikiOne--server 8083 $:/core/save/lazy-images text/plain text/html "" "" 0.0.0.0
```

Make sure that second line is all on one line in your batch file.

Put that file into the folder that contains all your wiki folderss. Similar to:

* FolderOfWikis
** WikiOne
** WikiTwo

In that case I would put the file in the folder called FolderOfWikis

Now when you double click the file you will start the WikiOne TiddlyWiki on port 8083
