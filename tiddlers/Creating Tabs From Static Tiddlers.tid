title: Creating Tabs From Static Tiddlers

Creating tabs to static tiddlers is easy. Just the syntax is:

```
<<tabs "[[GettingStarted]] [[Book Title A]] [[Book Title B]]" "[[GettingStarted]]">>
```
Which makes these there tabs:
<<tabs "[[GettingStarted]] [[Book Title A]] [[Book Title B]]" "[[GettingStarted]]">>
